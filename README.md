# What is this?
- **hyprwallpaper** is a simple terminal application written for linux distributions with the hyprland environment set up along with hyprpaper as the wallpaper manager. 
- This simple program written in python allows the user the quickly switch between different wallpapers without having to go into their config file to change it.

# How do i use it?
- download the python script as it is, as a raw file
- make sure your config file is located in /home/*your username*/.config/hypr/
- navigate into wherever you have downloaded the raw file and run the program with ``` python hyprwallpaper.py```
- just follow the simple prompts given in the program

# message
- this is a small beginner project I made for myself to make switching between my wallpapers faster. I am aware that it is very elementary and can use a lot more improvements, which I hope to add in the future as I become better at programming
- any suggestions are welcome :) I will try my best to address them
